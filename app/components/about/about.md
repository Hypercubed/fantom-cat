# About FANTOM CAT

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are largely heterogeneous and functionally uncharacterized. Using FANTOM5 Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) data we integrated multiple transcript collections to generate a comprehensive catalog of 23,887 high-confidence 5’ complete human lncRNA genes and their expression profiles across 1,829 samples from the major human primary cell types and tissues. Genomic and epigenomic classifications of these lncRNAs revealed that most intergenic lncRNAs are derived from enhancer-like regions rather than from promoters. Incorporating genetic and expression data we showed that trait-associated SNPs enriched at lncRNA loci were specifically expressed in the relevant cell-types, suggesting their roles in numerous diseases. We further demonstrated that thousands of lncRNA loci overlapping eQTL-associated SNPs were co-expressed with the mRNA target of the eQTL. Combining these findings with conservation data allowed us to identify 16,832 potentially functional lncRNA loci in human. The functional evidence and annotations of our lncRNA catalog are summarized and available as a web resource.

# About Project χ

This website was built using the Project χ platform. Project χ (pronounced project kai or /<abbr title="/ˈ/ primary stress follows">ˈ</abbr><abbr title="'k' in 'kind'">k</abbr><abbr title="/iː/ long 'e' in 'bead'">iː</abbr>/) is an modular open source visualization gallery framework built by Jayson Harshbarger at the [RIKEN Institute in Yokohama Japan](http://www.yokohama.riken.jp/english/).  It offers a framework and toolset for building self-hosted data-centric visualization websites. Geared towards sharing of supplemental materials associated with scientific publications; Project χ allows visitors to interact with visualizations, download associated data and images, and even try the visualization with their own uploaded or publicly available datasets.  For developers the framework comes packaged with tools necessary for quickly integrating interactive visualizations using [d3.js](http://d3js.org/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), and [BioJS](http://biojs.io/). Features of the framework include:

* Simple,  modular, and customizable design using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) templates and [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework.
* Supports CommonJS, AMD, and ES6 modules using the [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) Universal dynamic module loader.
* Integrate additional visualizations, including [BioJS](http://biojs.io/) and [Chiasm](https://github.com/curran/chiasm) modules, directly from any registry such as [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com/) using [JSPM](http://jspm.io/).
* Self-hosted fully client-side application doesn't require a server; easily hosted on [WebDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
* Contains AngularJS services and directives for loading, parsing, and downloading data and as well as downloading generated publication quality SVG images.
